\section{Introduction}

This report will summarize the main points describing the process of making a software product for a Top Trumps game in Java.

It starts off with an outline of the preliminary work required to initiate the work, including the requirements analysis as identified by the team, Sprint planning for both the Command Line and Online modes of the game, and also Burndown Charts reflecting remaining story points as a function of time with expected and actual measurements.

It continues with a section about the assumptions made for the implementation of the product and a chapter summarising the functionality, game logic and database behaviour for both modes.

Details of testing for each story with corresponding results follow after that, as well as a section about the current state of the program, under the deficiencies section.

Finally, the appendices contain information about the minutes of meetings (Appendix \ref{appendix:mom}), the customer specification defining the requirements (Appendix \ref{appendix:customer_specification}), flash cards with final User Stories with descriptions and acceptance tests (Appendix \ref{appendix:user_stories}), and concludes with supporting screenshots that are referenced throughout the report (Appendix \ref{appendix:screenshots}).
