\subsection{User Stories}

Personas and brainstorming of initial user stories were populated on a Trello board per Figure \ref{fig:user_stories_trello}.
Stories found to duplicate the intent of existing stories were ``binned''. 
Reference is made to Appendix \ref{appendix:sprint1_planning_meeting} for minutes of the initial planning meeting, where User Stories were finalised.
