\subsection{User Stories}

An initial set of user stories were brainstormed by each team member and posted on a Trello board. 
Reference is made to Appendix \ref{appendix:sprint1_planning_meeting} for minutes of the initial planning meeting, where user stories were finalised.
To ensure full coverage of requirements, a \todo{Should we include an updated coverage matrix in an appendix?} coverage matrix was produced to give the team confidence the main aspects were captured.

The final set of user stories can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix:user_stories}.
