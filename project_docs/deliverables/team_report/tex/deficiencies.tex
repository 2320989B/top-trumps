\subsection{Deficiencies}

The program has been tested thoroughly, during different steps of development, after every sprint in a larger scale, and as a final complete product multiple times. No missing functionality has been observed, and all tests were passed and double- checked as discussed in section 4 (Testing). 

Minor points can be mentioned, but again they are not part of functionality and they do not affect the program in any way. For example, in command line mode, cards are represented graphically as rectangles. If the user tries to reduce the terminal window size below a certain point, the rectangles overlap and do not re-shape automatically to fit the window. It is assumed though, that player would not want to run the game in a very small terminal,so that should not be an issue. Perhaps this would be something to adjust if the period available for the project completion was a little longer.
