\section{Testing}
\subsection{Command Line Mode}
The tests have been derived from the user stories. It is necessary to mention that the presented tests are from the user point of view, while there were numerous tests at the back-end during the development of the program that are not included. \\
\vspace{0.1cm}\\
The user persona Bob, wants to play a Top Trumps game in the command line.    
\vspace{0.2cm}\\
\begin{tabular}{l | p{12cm}}
User Story & \textbf{S0010} \\
\hline
Type of Test & Initiate the game from command line\\
\hline
Used Variable & 
 - "java -jar ITSD2018Project-1.0.jar -c" \\
 & 
 - "java -jar ITSD2018Project-1.0.jar -c -t"
\\
\hline
Result & [Passed] The program returns the main menu to the player, (figure 1 Appendix). As shown above, both game options were used as variables to test the initialisation of the game.\\ 
\hline
Anti-Variables & - "java -jar ITSD2018Project-1.0.jar -command"\\
& - "java -jar ITSD2018Project-1.0.jar -c -o"\\
& - "java -jar ITSD2018Project-1.0.jar -n"...\\
\hline
Results & [Exception] The program never initiates the game, if the flag is anything else excepts "-c", "-c -t" or "-o". The program throws an exception in case where the user tries to operate both modes, command line mode and on-line mode. In all other cases the program shows the greeting message and terminates.\\
\hline

The user persona Bob can now select one of the three options of the game.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}\\
\begin{tabular}{l | p{12cm}}
User Story & \textbf{S0010}\\ \hline
Type of Test & Select an integer number from the provided options of the main menu.\\ \hline
Used Variables & - integer number, where n=[1,3].\\ \hline
Result & [Passed] The player enter the integer n=1, which initiates a new game. The program returned with a new game.\\ \hline
Anti-Variables & - String\\
& - Character\\
& - Double or Integer, where n!=[1,3]\\
\hline
Results & [Exception] The program throws an exception when the player does not enter the specified integer between n = [1,2,3]. In case the player enters a different integer, the program throws a message indicating the exact integer variable, where in all other situations the program prints out a message demanding an integer.\\ \hline
