\subsection{Requirements Analysis}

Prior to generating user stories, the team took a disciplined approach to mapping out requirements.
Functional and non-functional requirements were extracted from the provided specification document (ITSD2018-TaskDocument), and a ``customer specification'' was produced, which formed the basis for generation of user stories.
Each requirement is given a unique requirement ID, allowing individual requirements to be discussed without confusion, and to allow cross-referencing with user stories.

A copy of the customer specification is provided in Appendix \ref{appendix:customer_specification}.
